Marketing Analysis

Situation

To improve marketing of a company, As a data analyst, I decided to analyze the marketing campaign data of an organization to ensure better profits and to improve overall marketing strategies. The existing marketing strategies of the company is not optimized which can be improved from campaigns data and that is the goal of this project.

Task

As the principal data analyst in this project, my mission was to generate actionable insights from the campaigns data which will enable the businesses to take informed business and marketing decision to enhance profits and more.

Action

I started by getting campaign data that company is running since weeks. After understanding data structure, I cleaned, pre-processed and transformed data to ensure integrity and quality of data. The code snippet for few data cleaning and transformation queries are given below:

After loading, cleaning and transforming data, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL to understand variables and gain deeper understanding and basic insight. Here’s a glimpse at some of the SQL queries used in the EDA.

After EDA, I went deep into the data and performed in-depth analysis, here’s a glimpse of the SQL queries

Result

The SQL script for marketing analysis was developed within time, and this is capable to handle massive amount of campaign/marketing data and performs cleaning, pre-processing, transforming data along with EDA and in-depth analysis which generates actionable insights effectively.

Quantifiable Result in terms of Script include

    Performs data cleaning, pre-processing and transforms data to ensure 99% data accuracy.
    Handles multiple types of data inconsistencies such as ‘%’ sign, ‘£’ sign, thousand separators and more which improve data consistency by 95%.
    Corrects data type and ensure their correctness according to variable which enhances operations by 30%.
    Updates campaigns title for better readability and understanding which improves readability by 70%.
    Performs EDA which speeds up insight generation by 30%.
    Performs in-depth analysis which generates actionable insights and enhances business decisions by 80%.

Some quantifiable results of the EDA and in-depth analyses include:

    Week 27’s August Look Book launch delivered maximum emails that is 180011.
    Week 27 generates maximum revenue that is £709625.46 while it is least for week 29 that is £277500.81.

Below are some visuals to help understand the analysis in a better way.

Note: Please note that below are just glimpse of actual analysis that I performed and as it is a SQL focused project, more emphasis is on SQL.
